## 🎯 How It Works

### User Flow
1. User selects device brand (Apple, Samsung, etc.)
2. User selects device type (iPhone, iPad, etc.)
3. User selects specific model (e.g., iPhone 17 Pro Max)
4. User selects repair type (Screen, Battery, Camera, etc.)
5. **NEW**: User sees 3 quality tier options with prices
6. User selects preferred quality tier
7. System calculates total with tax and travel fee
8. User proceeds to booking

### Pricing Logic
```javascript
// For iPhone repairs:
if (deviceType === 'iPhone') {
  // Show 3 tiers
  oem: Apple official pricing
  premium: Market-competitive pricing
  economy: Budget pricing (65% of premium)
}

// For other devices:
// Uses simple pricing (to be enhanced later)
```

## 💻 Installation Requirements

### Backend Dependencies
```bash
cd backend
npm install puppeteer  # For web scraping
npm install node-cron  # For scheduled jobs
npm install dotenv     # For environment variables
```

### Environment Variables
Create `backend/.env`:
```env
# Apple Pricing
APPLE_GSX_USERNAME=your_username  # If you have Apple GSX access
APPLE_GSX_PASSWORD=your_password

# MobileSentrix API (when ready)
MOBILESENTRIX_API_KEY=your_api_key

# OpenAI (for AI optimization - optional)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_key

# Database
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://user:pass@localhost/instakyle

# Pricing Update Schedule
PRICING_UPDATE_CRON=0 2 * * *  # Daily at 2 AM
```

## 🔧 Usage Examples

### Update Apple Prices Manually
```javascript
const ApplePriceScraper = require('./backend/src/services/ApplePriceScraper');

// Scrape latest prices
const prices = await ApplePriceScraper.scrapeAllPrices();

// Get specific price
const price = ApplePriceScraper.getPrice('iPhone 17 Pro Max', 'Screen Repair');
console.log(price); // 379.00
```

### Get Dynamic Pricing
```javascript
const DynamicPricingService = require('./backend/src/services/DynamicPricingService');

const pricing = await DynamicPricingService.getPricing({
  deviceType: 'iPhone',
  deviceModel: 'iPhone 17 Pro Max',
  repairType: 'Screen Repair',
  qualityTier: 'premium'
});

console.log(pricing);
// {
//   price: 149.99,
//   lastUpdated: '2025-10-18T...',
//   source: 'market_analysis',
//   confidence: 0.95
// }
```

### Schedule Automatic Updates
```javascript
const cron = require('node-cron');
const DynamicPricingService = require('./backend/src/services/DynamicPricingService');

// Update prices daily at 2 AM
cron.schedule('0 2 * * *', async () => {
  console.log('Running daily pricing update...');
  await DynamicPricingService.updateAllPricing();
  console.log('Pricing update complete');
});
```

## 🎨 UI Components

### Tier Cards
The quality tier selection uses styled cards with:
- Color-coded badges
- Recommended tier highlighting
- Hover animations
- Mobile-responsive grid
- Clear price display

### CSS Classes
```css
.quality-tier-section    - Container for tier selection
.tier-cards             - Grid of tier options
.tier-card              - Individual tier card
.tier-card.selected     - Selected tier styling
.tier-card.recommended  - Recommended tier badge
.tier-badge            - Quality tier badge
.tier-price            - Price display
```

## 📱 Mobile Responsive

All tier cards automatically adapt to mobile:
- Stack vertically on small screens
- Touch-friendly tap targets
- Optimized animations for mobile
- Readable text sizes

## 🔐 Security

- API keys stored in environment variables
- Rate limiting on scrapers (prevents IP bans)
- Price validation (min/max bounds)
- Audit trail for all price changes

## 📈 Expected Benefits

1. **Competitive Pricing**: Always match or beat Apple's prices
2. **Customer Choice**: 3 tiers serve different customer needs
